==== Uncache Address Window Configuration Register

The address window hit formula is detailed in <<receive-address-window-configuration-register,Receive Address Window Configuration Register>>.

The address of this window is the address received on the HT bus.
A read or write command that lands in this window will not be sent to SCache and will not invalidate the first-level Cache, but will be sent directly to memory or other address space, i.e., the read or write command in this address window will not maintain Cache consistency of the I/O.
This window is mainly for some operations that will not hit in Cache and therefore can improve the efficiency of accessing memory, such as accessing video memory.

Offset: `0x190`

Reset value: `0x00000000`
