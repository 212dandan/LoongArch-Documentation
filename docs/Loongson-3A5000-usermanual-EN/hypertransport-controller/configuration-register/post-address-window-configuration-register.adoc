==== POST Address Window Configuration Register

The address window hit formula is detailed in <<receive-address-window-configuration-register,Receive Address Window Configuration Register>>.

The address in this window is the address received on the AXI bus.
All write accesses that land in this window will be returned immediately on the `AXI B` channel and sent to the HT bus in the `POST WRITE` command format.
Write requests not in this window, on the other hand, are sent to the HT bus in `NONPOST WRITE` format and wait for the HT bus response before returning to the AXI bus.

Offset: `0x170`

Reset value: `0x00000000`
