==== External Interrupt Conversion Configuration

This setting converts an interrupt received by the HT into a write operation to a specific address that is written directly to the extended I/O interrupt vector inside the chip, rather than generating an interrupt inside the HT controller.
With this approach, advanced features such as direct cross-chip distribution of I/O interrupts can be used.
