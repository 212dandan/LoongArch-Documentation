==== Receive Address Window Configuration Register

The formula for hitting the address window in the HT controller is as follows:

[source]
----
hit = ( BASE & MASK ) == ( ADDR & MASK )
addr_out_trans = TRANS_EN ? TRANS | ADDR & ~MASK : ADDR
addr_out = Multi_node_en ?
addr_out_trans[39:37], addr_out_trans[43:40], 3'b0,addr_out[36:0]:
addr_out_trans
----

It should be noted that when configuring the address window register, the high bits of `MASK` should be all 1s and the low bits should be all `0` values.
The actual number of bits of `0` in `MASK` indicates the size of the address window.

The address of the receive address window is the address received on the HT bus.
HT addresses that fall within the P2P window will be forwarded back to the HT bus as P2P commands, HT addresses that fall within the normal receive window and are not in the P2P window will be sent to the CPU, and commands for other addresses will be forwarded back to the HT bus as P2P commands.

Offset: `0x140`
