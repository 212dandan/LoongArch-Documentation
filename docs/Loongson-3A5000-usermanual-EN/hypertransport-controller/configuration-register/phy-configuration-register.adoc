==== PHY Configuration Register

Used to configure PHY related physical parameters, when the controller is two independent 8-bit controllers, the high PHY and low PHY are controlled independently by the two controllers.
When the controller is one 16-bit controller, the configuration parameters of the high and low PHY are unified by the low controller.

Offset: `0x1FC`

Reset value: `0x83308000`

Name: PHY configuration register
