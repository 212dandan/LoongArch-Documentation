=== HyperTransport Multi-processor Support

The loongson3 processor uses the HyperTransport interface for multiprocessor interconnects and can automatically maintain consistency requests between `2`-`8` chips in hardware.

*Loongson 3 Interconnect Routing*

Loongson 3 interconnect routing has two methods, one is to use the simple `X`-`Y` routing method.
If a request is sent from `11` to `00`, it is routed from `11` to `00`, first in the `X` direction, from `11` to `10`, and then in the `Y` direction, from `10` to `00`.
When its response returns from `00` to `11`, it is routed first in the `X` direction, from `00` to `01`, and then in the `Y` direction, from `01` to `11`.
from `00` to `01`, and then the `Y` direction, from `01` to `11`.
The other is diagonal direct access, which is achieved by connecting two diagonal chips in hardware to greatly reduce access latency, and this access requires separate enablement through software.
Due to the characteristics of this algorithm, a variety of different approaches can be used when building multi-chip interconnects.

*Structure of Four Loongson 3 Chips Interconnected*

The four CPUs are connected in a two-by-two ring structure.
Each CPU is connected to two adjacent chips using the two 8-bit controllers of `HT0` and to the diagonal chip using `HT1 HI`, resulting in the interconnection structure shown below:

*Structure of Sixteen Loongson 3 Chips Interconnected*

The sixteen interconnects use the remaining `HT1_LO` after the above four interconnects (called Clusters) for interconnecting between Clusters.
The structure is as follows:

*Structure of Two Loongson 3 Chips with 8-bit Interconnection*

8-bit HT bus interconnect.
In this interconnect, only 8-bit HT interconnects can be used between the two processors.
The two chip numbers are `00` and `01` respectively, and from the routing algorithm, it can be known that both chips access each other through the same 8-bit HT bus as in the four-chip interconnect.
This is shown below:

However, the HT bus can be used in 16-bit mode at the widest, and the resulting connection method to maximize bandwidth should be to use a 16-bit interconnect structure.
In Loongson 3, as long as the `HT0` controller is set to 16-bit mode, all commands sent to the HT0 controller will be sent to `HT0_LO` instead of to `HT0_HI` or `HT0_LO` respectively according to the routing table as before, so that the 16-bit bus for interconnection can be used.
So, only need to configure the 16-bit mode of `CPU0` and `CPU1` correctly and connect the high and low buses correctly to use the 16-bit HT bus interconnect.
This interconnection structure can also be accessed using the 8-bit HT bus protocol.
The resulting interconnection structure is as follows:
