=== HyperTransport Protocol Support

The Loongson 3A5000's HyperTransport bus supports most commands in the version 1.03/3.0 protocol and includes some extended commands in the extended conformance protocol that supports multi-chip interconnects.
The commands that can be received by the HyperTransport receiver in both of these modes are shown in the table below.
Note that atomic operation commands for the HyperTransport bus are not supported.
