== Physical Address Space Layout

The Loongson 3 Seriesprocessor has a globally accessible hierarchical addressing design for system physical address distribution to ensure extended system development compatibility.
The physical address width of the entire system is `48` bits.
The entire address space is evenly distributed over 16 nodes according to the high `4` bits of the address, i.e., `44` bits of address space per node.
