==== Configuration Address for Stable Timer

Using the Stable counter clock source, a monotonically increasing timer counter and a timer timer that decrements down from the set value are implemented; each processor core has its own independent Stable counter and Stable timer.
When the processor accesses the timer, it can only be accessed by `rdhwr`, `DRDTIME` and other specific instructions; when the processor accesses the timer, it can be accessed by address to load/store or by CSR configuration register instructions.

5+<|timer_config

|63
|1
|RW
|0x1
|Reset to `1`, and should write `1`

|62
|Periodic
|RW
|0x0
|Cycle count enable.
When this bit is `1`, the timer is automatically reset to the value of the `InitVal` field in `timer_config` after decreasing to `0`

|61
|Enable
|RW
|0x0
|General enable.
The timer is active when this bit is `1`

|47:0
|InitVal
|RW
|0x0
|The initial value for conducting the countdown

5+<|timer_ticks

|63:48
|0
|R
|0x0
|Value `0`

|47:0
|Ticks
|R
|0x0
|The remaining value of the countdown.
When not in a cycle count, the value will stay at `48'hffff_ffff_ffff` when the count is complete
