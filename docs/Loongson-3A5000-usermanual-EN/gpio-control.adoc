== GPIO Control

Up to `32` GPIOs are provided in the 3A5000 for system use, and most of them are multiplexed with other functions.
The GPIOs can also be configured as interrupt inputs and their interrupt levels can be set through register settings.

The base address of each chip configuration register in this chapter is `0x1fe00000`.
