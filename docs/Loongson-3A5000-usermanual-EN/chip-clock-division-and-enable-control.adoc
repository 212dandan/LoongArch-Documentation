== Chip Clock Division and Enable Control

The Loongson 3A5000 can use a single external reference clock, `SYS_CLOCK`.
The generation of each clock can depend on `SYS_CLOCK`, and the following sections describe each of these clocks.

The Loongson 3A5000 has separate frequency dividing mechanisms for the processor core, on-chip network and shared Cache, HT controller, and LA132 core.
In line with the 3A4000, the 3A5000 also supports `1/n` divider values,It can also be accessed using the configuration register instruction (IOCSR).

The base address of each chip configuration register in this chapter is `0x1fe00000`.
