=== Introduction to Chip Module clock

The chip reference clock `SYS_CLOCK` usually uses a `100MHz` crystal input, but a `25MHz` crystal input is also available.
Different crystal frequencies need to be selected via `CLKSEL[4]`.

The reference clock of the HT PHY can use the `200MHz` differential reference input of each PHY in addition to the SYS CLOCK.
Use `CLKSEL[8]` to make the selection.
When SYS CLOCK is selected as the reference clock and a `25MHz` crystal input is used, the HT PHY cannot operate at `3.2GHz`.

The clocks used in the Loongson 3A5000 chip and their control methods are shown in the following table.
