== LA464 Processor Core

LA464 is a quad-launch 64-bit high-performance processor core.
It can be used as a single core for high-end embedded and desktop applications, or as a basic processor core to form an on-chip multi-core system for server and high-performance machine applications.
The multiple LA464 cores in the Loongson 3A5000 form a distributed multi-core architecture with a shared on-chip last-level Cache through the AXI interconnect network.
The main features of LA464 are as follows:

* Support for the Loongson autonomous instruction set (LoongArch).

* Four-launch superscalar architecture with four fixed-point, two vector, and two access components.

* Each vector component is `256` bits wide, and each component supports up to eight double 32-bit floating-point multiplication and addition operations.

* Access components support 256-bit memory access, with 64-bit virtual addresses and 48-bit physical addresses.

* support for register renaming, dynamic scheduling, transfer prediction, and other chaotic execution techniques.

* 64 fully-associative items plus `2048` items connected in 8-way groups, for a total of `2112` TLBs, `64` instruction TLBs, and variable page size.

* First-level instruction Cache and data Cache size of `64KB` each, 4-way group concatenation.

* Victim Cache as a private secondary Cache, `256KB` in size, 16-way group concatenation.

* Supports access optimization techniques such as Non-blocking access and Load-Speculation.

* Supports Cache Consistency Protocol for on-chip multi-core processors.

* Supports parity check for first-level Cache and ECC check for second-level, on-chip last-level Cache.

* Supports standard JTAG debugging interface for easy hardware and software debugging.
