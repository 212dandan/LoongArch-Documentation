=== Accessing by Address

For the Loongson 3A5000, the following registers can be accessed using base address `0x1fe0_0000`,It can also be accessed using the configuration register instruction (IOCSR).
Of these, base address `0x3ff0_0000` can be turned off by the `disable_0x3ff0` control bit in the Routing Setup Register.
See the tables below for specific register descriptions and addresses.

The above is a list of inter-processor interrupt-related registers for a single-node multiprocessor system composed of a single Loongson 3A5000 chip.
When multiple Loongson 3A5000 chips are interconnected to form a multi-node CC-NUMA system, each node within a chip corresponds to a global system node number, and the IPI register addresses of the processor cores within the node are fixed at an offset from the base address of the node in the table above.
For example, the IPI_Status address of processor core 0 of node 0 is `0x1fe01000`, while the processor address of processor 0 of node 1 is `0x10001fe01000`, and so on.
