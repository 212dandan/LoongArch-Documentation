=== Processor Core Frequency Division Configuration Register (`0x01D0`)

The following registers are used for dynamic frequency division of the processor core.
Using this register to set the frequency of the processor core, the frequency conversion operation can be done within 100ns with no additional overhead.
The base address is `0x1fe00000` and the offset address is `0x01d0`.
