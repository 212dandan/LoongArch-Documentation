==== Arbitrary Operation Control Bus

The memory controller can send any combination of commands to DRAM via command send mode.
The software can set `Cmd_cs`, `Cmd_cmd`, `Cmd_ba`, `Cmd_a` (`0x1128`) to be sent to DRAM in command send mode.

The specific operation is as follows:

. Set registers `Cmd_cs`, `Cmd_cmd`, `Cmd_ba`, `Cmd_a` (`0x1128`) to the correct values.

. Set `Command_mode` (`0x1120`) to `1` to put the controller into command sending mode;

. Sample `Status_cmd` (`0x1122`), if it is `1`, the controller is in command sending mode and can proceed to the next operation, if it is `0`, it needs to continue to wait;

.Write `Cmd_req` (`0x1121`) to `1` to send a command to DRAM.

. Set `Command_mode` (`0x1120`) to `0` to make the controller exit the command sending mode.
