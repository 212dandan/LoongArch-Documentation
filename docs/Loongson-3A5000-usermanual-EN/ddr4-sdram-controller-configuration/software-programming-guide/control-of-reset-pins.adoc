==== Control of Reset Pins

For simpler control of reset pins in states such as STR, special reset pin (`DDR_RESETn`) control can be performed via the `pad_reset_po` (`0x808`) register, and there are two main control modes:

. General mode, `reset_ctrl[1:0] == 2'b00`.
The behavior of the reset signal pins in this mode is compatible with the general control mode.
`DDR_RESETn` is connected directly on the motherboard to the corresponding pin on the memory slot.
The behavior of the pin is:

* When not powered up: pin status is low.

* At power-up: pin state is low.

* When the controller starts initialization: pin state is high.

* During normal operation: pin state is high.

The timing is shown in the figure below:

. Reverse mode, `reset_ctrl[1:0] == 2'b10`.
In this mode, the reset signal pins are at the opposite effective level from the normal control mode when doing the actual memory control.
So the motherboard needs to connect DDR_RESETn to the corresponding pin on the memory slot through the inverter.
The pin behavior is:
+
* When not powered up: the pin state is low.

* At power-up: pin state is low.

* When the controller starts configuration: pin state is high.

* When the controller starts initialization: pin state is low.

* During normal operation: pin state is low.

The timing sequence is shown in the following figure:

. Reset disable mode, `pm_pad_reset_o[1:0] == 2'b01`.
In this mode, the reset signal pin remains low during the whole memory operation.
So the motherboard needs to connect DDR_RESETn to the corresponding pin on the memory slot through the inverter.
The behavior of the pins is:
+
* always low.

The timing is shown in the following diagram:

By the latter two reset modes in conjunction, STR control can be achieved directly with the use of the memory controller's reset signal.
When the whole system is booted from the shutdown state, use the method 2 to use the memory stick to reset normally and start working.
When the system resumes from STR, the method 3 is used to reconfigure the memory stick so that it starts working properly again without destroying the original state of the memory stick.
