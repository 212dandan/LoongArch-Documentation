==== Control of the Use of ECC Function

The ECC function is only available in 64-bit mode.
`ecc_enable` (`0x1280`) consists of the following `2` control bits:

`Ecc_enable[0]` controls whether to enable the ECC function, which is enabled only if this valid bit is set.
`Ecc_enable[1]` controls whether to report errors through the processor's internal read response path, so that a read access with an ECC two-bit error can immediately cause an exception to occur in the processor core.

In addition, ECC errors can be notified to the processor core via an interrupt.
This interrupt is controlled through Int_enable.
The interrupt consists of two vectors, `Int_vector[0]` for an ECC error (both 1-bit and 2-bit errors) and `Int_vecotr[1]` for an ECC two-bit error.
Clearance of `Int_vector` is achieved by writing `1` to the corresponding bit.
