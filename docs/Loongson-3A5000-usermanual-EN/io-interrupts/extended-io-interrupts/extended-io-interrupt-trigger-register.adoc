==== Extended I/O Interrupt Trigger Register

To support the dynamic distribution of extended I/O interrupts, an extended I/O interrupt trigger register is added to the configuration register to set the corresponding I/O interrupts to be set.
This register can be used for debugging or testing interrupts in normal times.

The description of this register is as follows:
