=== UART Controller

The UART controller has the following features

* Full duplex asynchronous data receive/send

* Programmable data format

* 16-bit programmable clock counter

* Support for receive timeout detection

* Multi-interrupt system with arbitration

* FIFO-only operation

* Compatible with NS16550A in terms of registers and functions

Two UART interfaces are integrated inside the chip, and the functional registers are exactly the same, only the access base address is different.
UART0 register physical address base address is `0x1FE001E0`.

UART1 register physical address base address is `0x1FE001E8`.

A physical address is also provided for each of the two UARTs, `0x1FE00100` (`UART0`) and `0x1FE00110` (`UART1`) respectively.
The two additional registers `RFC` and `TFC` can be accessed through this set of addresses.
