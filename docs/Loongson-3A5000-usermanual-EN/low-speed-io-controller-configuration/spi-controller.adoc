=== SPI Controller

The SPI controller has the following features:

* Full-duplex synchronous serial data transmission

* Variable length byte transport support up to `4`

* Master mode support

* Mode failure generates an error flag and issues an interrupt request

* Dual buffered receivers

* Polarity and phase programmable serial clock

* SPI can be controlled in wait mode

* Boot from SPI support

* Dual/Quad mode SPI FLASH support

The SPI controller register physical address base address is `0x1FE001F0`.

The SPI Boot address space is the first address space accessed by the processor when the system boots up, and the `0xBFC00000` address is automatically routed to the SPI.

The SPI Memory space can also be accessed directly through a read request from the CPU, and its minimum `1M` bytes overlap with the SPI BOOT space.
