|phy_cfg_data
|R/W
|PHY configuration reads and writes data. In the write operation, the data is written to this register first, and then the write operation is performed. In the read operation, the read data returned from PHY is stored into this register.

|phy_cfg_done
|R/W
|PHY One access completion indicates the completion of this read/write to the PHY. Write completion indicates that the write indicates that the read data has been written to the internal register of PHY, and the read completion indicates that the read data has been returned to the phy_cfg_data register.
