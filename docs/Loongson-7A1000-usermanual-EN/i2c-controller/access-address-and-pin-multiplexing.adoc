=== Access Address and Pin Multiplexing

The base address of accessing the I2C controller is the base address of the MISC low-speed device block plus an offset of `0x10000`.

*Note*: The I2C module only supports access by 1 byte.

The physical address composition of the I2C module internal registers is as follows.

For I2C modules, the corresponding pins should be set to the corresponding functions when used.
The pin settings related to I2C are described in <<pin-multiplexing-configuration-register,Pin Multiplexing Configuration Register>>.
