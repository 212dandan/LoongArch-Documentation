== PWM Controller

A four-way pulse width output/counter controller (PWM) is implemented in the bridge.
The four PWMs The four PWMs work and control in exactly the same way.
Each PWM pin can be used as either a pulse output signal or a pulse width measurement input signal.
The PMW controller clock is `50MHz`, and the count and reference registers are 32-bit length.
