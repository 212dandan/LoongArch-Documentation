=== LPC Access Address

The LPC controller consists of three address spaces: the control register space, the MEM space, and the I/O space.

The LPC control register space is used to configure the LPC controller, which is located in the fixed device address space of the bridge chip, starting at `0x1000,2000`, with a size of `4KB`.

The LPC MEM space is used to access the Memory/Firmware Memory devices mounted on the LPC bus.
The LPC MEM space is located in the fixed device address space of the bridge chip starting at `0x1200,0000` and is `32MB` in size.
Processor accesses to the LPC MEM space are converted to LPC protocol Memory accesses and sent to the LPC bus.
Which type of Memory access is issued by the LPC controller is determined by the LPC controller's control registers.
Addresses sent by the processor to this address space can be address converted.
The converted address is set by the LPC controller's configuration register (`LPC_MEM_TRANS`).
