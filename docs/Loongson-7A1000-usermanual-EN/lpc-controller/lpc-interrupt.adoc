=== LPC Interrupt

The LPC controller internally includes two types of interrupts: SIRQ interrupts and access timeout interrupts.
The LPC controller supports a total of 17 SIRQ interrupts, corresponding to the `bits[16:0]` of the interrupt-related register.
The access timeout interrupt corresponds to the `bit[17]` of the interrupt-related register.

The SIRQ interrupt is a level-triggered interrupt, and the value of the trigger level can be configured by the register.
The software should configure the trigger level of the SIRQ interrupt before enabling the SIRQ interrupt of the LPC controller.
The SIRQ interrupt does not need to be cleared by software.

The access timeout interrupt is edge-triggered, so if an LPC access timeout interrupt occurs, the software needs to write `bit[17]` of the interrupt clear register to clear the interrupt.
