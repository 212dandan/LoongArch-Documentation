Note:

. The correct value of the subclass code for all PCIE controllers integrated in the bridge should be 0x04 for the PCI-to-PCI bridge, but this bridge incorrectly implements this value as 0x00 (for the Host bridge).
The software needs to ignore this bit field and still handle the bridge-integrated PCIE controllers as PCI-to-PCI bridges, see <<notes-on-the-use-of-the-software,Notes on the Use of the Software>>.

. Only one device (Device 0) can be mounted on the bus below all PCIE controllers integrated in the bridge, but when the software scans the PCIE bus for non-Device 0 devices, this PCIE controller will return the information of Device 0, causing Device 0 to be discovered repeatedly.
Therefore, the software must not actively scan for non-Device 0 devices below the PCIE controller, see <<notes-on-the-use-of-the-software,Notes on the Use of the Software>>.
