== RTC

The **R**eal **T**ime **C**lock (RTC) unit can be configured when the motherboard is powered up, and when the motherboard is powered down, the unit still operates and can run normally on the on-board battery power alone.
The RTC unit operates with only a few microamps of current.

The RTC contains an oscillator, which in combination with an external `32.768KHZ` crystal generates the operating clock.
This clock is used for time information maintenance and is used to maintain time information and to generate various timing and counting interrupts.

The RTC module contains two counters, the TOY (Time of Year) counter and the RTC counter.
The TOY counter counts in years, months, hours, minutes and seconds with an accuracy of `0.1s`.
The RTC counter counts at `32.768KHz` and is 32-bit length.
