Note: Address space not listed in the table indicates reserved.

Registers that differ slightly from the PCI configuration header specification and their descriptions are listed below.

*`PCICMD` - PCI Command Register (SPI - `D22:F0`)*

Address Offset: `04`-`05h`

Attribute: R/W, RO

Default value: `0000h`

Size: `16` bits

|Reserved.

|1
|Memory Space Enable
|R/W
|This bit is used to control whether access to the SPI control registers and SPI memory space is enabled.

`0`: Disable access.

`1`: Enable access to the SPI control registers and SPI memory space.
The `BAR` register must be configured before this bit can be configured to `1`.

|0
|Reserved
|RO
|Reserved.

The SPI controller consists of two address spaces: the control register space and the memory space.

*`CNL_BAR` - Control Base Address Register*

This register is used to configure the base address of the control registers of the SPI controler.

Address Offset: `10`-`13h`

Attribute: R/W, RO

Default value: `00000004h`

Size: `32` bits
