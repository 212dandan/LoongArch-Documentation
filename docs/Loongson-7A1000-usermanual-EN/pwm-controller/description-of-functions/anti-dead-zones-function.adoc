==== Anti Dead Zones Function

Multiple PWMs are equipped with an anti dead zones function between them, which prevents multiple pulse outputs from jumping at the same time.
To use the anti dead zones function, the multiple PWMs of the anti dead zones function must be numbered from `0` and be consecutive, and their anti dead zones functions must all be enabled.
In other words, one of `PWM0`/`1`, `PWM0`/`1`/`2` and `PWM0`/`1`/`2`/`3` must be used when using the anti dead zones function.

For `PWM_0`, `PWM_1`, `PWM_2`, and `PWM_3`, their priority is `0`> `1` > `2` > `3`.
If they jump at the same time, `PWM_1` will jump only after `PWM_0` jumps (the lower priority signal is "`erased`" by one clock cycle), and so on.
This priority is fixed and cannot be changed.

A typical anti dead zones example is as follows (`PWM_*` is the output when the anti dead zones function is disabled, and `PWM_*'` is the output when the anti dead zones function is enabled).
