=== Access Address and Pin Multiplexing

The base address of accessing the PWM controller is the base address of the MISC low-speed device block plus an offset of `0x20000`.

*Note*: The PWM module only supports access by 4 bytes.

The physical address composition of the PWM controller internal registers is as follows.

For PMM modules, the corresponding pins should be set to the corresponding functions when used.
The pin settings related to PMM are described in <<pin-multiplexing-configuration-register,Pin Multiplexing Configuration Register>>.
