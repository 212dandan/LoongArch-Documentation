=== Access Address

The address space size of the HPET controller is 4KB, and the starting address (internal space of the bridge chip) is configured by the BIOS.
The physical address composition of the internal registers of the HPET controller is as follows:

[[access-address]]
.Access address
[%header,cols="1m,^1m,2"]
|===
|Address bits
|Composition
|Remarks

|[11:08]
|0
|Reserved

|[07:00]
|REG
|Internal register address
|===

Note: The HPET controller only supports 4-byte accesses. Software that needs to use the HPET's 64-bit master counter as a timestamp needs to be careful to handle the data rounding introduced by reading the high and low 32-bit values in two separate readings.
