=== Description of Clock Function

The bridge contains multiple PLLs and clock divider modules to generate the individual clocks needed for the bridge.

The bridge contains 5 PLLs, each of which can provide up to 3 clock outputs. The five PLLs are used for the following purposes

* A device PLL to generate the clocks for USB/SATA, GMAC.

* A graphics PLL to generate clocks for GPU, DC, and graphics memory.

* One system PLL to generate clocks for the internal bus, HDA bitclk, flex clkout.

* Two PIX PLLs for generating two independent pixel clocks to support dual independent displays.
